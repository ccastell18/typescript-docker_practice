Type = easy way to refer to the different properties and functions that a value has
value = anything that can be assigned to a variable.

Primitive Types- numbers, booleans, void, undefined, string, symbol, null
Object Types = functions, arrays, classes, objects

Types are used by typescript compiler to analyze our code for errors
Types allow other engineers to understand what values are flowing around our codebase


Type Annotations + Type Inference
Type Annotations = code we add to tell Typescript what type of value a variable will refer to
Type Inference = Typescript tries to figure out what type of value a variable refers to
