Docker

Image is a single file with all the dependencies and config required to run a program
Container is an instance of an image. Runs a program.

Docker Client - Tool that we are going to issue commands to
Docker Server - Tool that is responsible for creating images, running containers, etc.

Steps a command goes through
use docker run ______
it will put command in Docker Client
The Client will check the server.
It will check the image cache to see if we have a local image.
If not, it will check Docker Hub (A free site) to see if it has an image that was requested
It moves image from Hub to image cache.  
The image can now create a container to run the program.

Container
Programs run on the computer
they make system calls
It goes into a KERNAL to govern access to CPU, Memory, etc.

Namespacing - isolating resources per process or group of processes(processes, network, user, hostnames, etc)
Control Groups (cgroups)- Limit amount of resources used per process(Memory, Network Bandwith, CPU Usage, etc)
both are exclusive to Linux. Only running on mac because it created a linux kernal. 

A container makes a system call to the KERNAL and it will make a portion of each made available to the process

The image will have a File System Snapshot and a startup command.  
when the command is run, the hard drive will portion out space for the container
The snapshot will be placed in that portion of the hard drive.
It will take an instance of the process and move it as the running process and use the resources alloted into the container.
